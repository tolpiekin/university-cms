# Task 3.10 Finallize app functionality
**Assignment**
1. Using your flows descriptions from task 3.1 create list of flows to implement, call it features, consult with Mentor if required.

Example:

Given Anonymous User `D`
- User 'D' should be able to list all courses with basic info (without schedule, teacher, groups and student information)
  ... etc

  
2. Consider feature implementation as subtask(made in new branch and merged into main/master on completion)

For each feature, implement UI pages(usually list, create, edit, delete, etc.), controller/controller methods, service/service methods, repository methods.

Controller tests are mandatory, add other components tests if required.
