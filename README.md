# Task 3.9 Implement Schedule view + edit features
**Assignment**
1. Using your flows descriptions from task 3.1 create list of flows to implement, call it features, consult with Mentor if required.
   Example:

Given User `A` logged in with Admin or Stuff role.
- User 'A' should be able to create/read/update/delete new schedule.
  Given User 'B' logged in with Student or Teacher role.
- User 'B' should be able to list all its schedules.
  ... etc
  
2. Consider feature implementation as subtask(made in new branch and merged into main/master on completion)
   For each feature, implement UI pages(usually list, create, edit, delete, etc.), controller/controller methods, service/service methods, repository methods.

Controller tests are mandatory, add other components tests if required.
